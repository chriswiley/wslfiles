# wslfiles

This is a testing file to see how to use wsl and windows based git gui's

Here is a change

More and more changes are afoot

I don't know how this will work out

Added another line here.

This is the final feature of the new branch.

Ok, so how can we see if this is ok then?

But does it see this?

Here is a change that no one will see, maybe?

this is on the master branch right now

Ok, so this is my new feature. Let's see if anyone likes it.

real last one
Ok, I am not sure what I am doing now

Now I am adding more lines here

Once in a while I like to see how this works
